A simple Emacs package to have regions spoken aloud by ~espeak~. This is NOT an
accessibility package; I wrote it primarily to avoid tired eyes after reading
long news articles.

The package does some preprocessing of the string it passes to ~espeak~. It will
replace raw URLs with their domain. I almost never want a full URL
read out -- it's meaningless.

The package's main functions are `elspeak-speak-region' and (if you're a Gnus
user like me) `elspeak-gnus-article'.

** Configuration
- If your ~espeak~ is not in your $PATH, you can change the location used:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq elspeak-executable "/location/to/espeak")
#+END_SRC
- You can change the default speed that ~espeak~ will speak at:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq elspeak-default-speed 150)
#+END_SRC
